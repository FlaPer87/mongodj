mongoDJ
-------

MongoDB backend for Django.

The aim of the project is to create a native django DB backend
for mongo (so that it can be accessed through the django ORM).

The project is in the *very* early stage

mongoDB is accessed through pyMongo.

It relies on the django-nonrel branch: http://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/django-nonrel/wiki/Home
